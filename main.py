# Problem:
# dx/dy = 2x + y
# y(0) = 1
# 0 <= x <= 1
# Solve the given differential equation using the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods

# Some background:

# Many useful first-order differential equations don't have a 'clean' algebraic solution
# We can still get an approximate solution using the Euler and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta methods

# I was given the above problem as homework for a Differential Equations course
# Runge-Kutta is very tedious to do by hand
# So, I wrote this program to do the tedious work for me
